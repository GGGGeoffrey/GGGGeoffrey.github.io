            I play a lot of different games. I like to play pokemon gamess. I also play games like Warframe and Beast Of Bermuada. Warframe is one of my favorite games.
            In Warframe you use a robotic body to do ninja stuff. The games movement and combat system is simple yet fun. The game requires a lot of grinding. This can easily cause burnout but when I come back to it, it's still really fun.
