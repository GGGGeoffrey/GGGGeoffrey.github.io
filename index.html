            I play a lot of different games. I like to play pokemon gamess. I also play games like Warframe and Beast Of Bermuada. Warframe is one of my favorite games.
            In Warframe you use a robotic body to do ninja stuff. The games movement and combat system is simple yet fun. The game requires a lot of grinding. This can easily cause burnout but when I come back to it, it's still really fun.

            Xaku is my favorite Warframe. In the lore it is complied of three different Warframes each broken during the Old War. Yareli is my second favorite Warframe. It is the reason the k-drive ,which is just a hoverboard, exist in the lore. The lore is one of my favorite aspects in most games, but Warframes lore is the best in my opinion.
